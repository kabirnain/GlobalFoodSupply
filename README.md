# GlobalFoodSupply

**Description**

This repository contains the analytics project focused on assessing global food security through various dimensions like production, trade, and land use. I have leveraged data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to derive valuable insights into the state of food security around the world, and how it's affected by geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
